# Memory Game

## How It Works

Let's play! If you are not familiar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two cards at a time to find the matching ones. 

The game board consists of twelve cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of six different pairs of cards, each with different illustrations on one side. 

Each turn:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying illustration
* The player turns over a second card, trying to find the one that matches the same illustration
* If the cards match, that's one point for you and both cards will dissapear from the game board
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

You will find the score beneath the board, as well as the number of movements or flips.

If you want to restart the game, you can do so by clicking the Restart button.

## What I've learned

* To fully combine HTLM5, CSS3 and Javascript into a project
* To work with empty arrays, as well as pushing and storing data in them
* To practice Advanced DOM (setAttribute, createElement, appendChild)
* To use inbuilt JavaScript functions such as Math.random and sort()
* To work with with loops
* To practice CSS transitions to improve the user's experience

## Web Application

You will find below some images of each state of the application, as well as some additional information of each one:

*With:*
*- The game board*
*- A score result*
*- A movement counter*
*- A restart button*

Once you flip a card, an illustration will show up, your goal will be to find the matching card. The illustrations used in the project can be found in the link below:
